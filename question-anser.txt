Which algorithm you will use? Why you choose this? Does CPU or GPU have an impact on your decision?
Answer: Here i use region of interset(ROI) method. We can use a pre-trained
object detection model. One common algorithm for object detection is the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) 
or the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm. These algorithms are fast and accurate for detecting objects in images.

why?
Efficiency
Object Detection Capability
Ease of Use
Accuracy


CPU or GPU?
In my case it doesn't depends but the choice depends on the specific model and its computational requirements. Generally, using a GPU can
significantly speed up the inference process, making real-time or near-real-time applications feasible. In deep
learning frameworks, including TensorFlow and PyTorch, support GPU acceleration.

What if given a video instead of images? Does your approach change?
Yes need to change the approach. We need to convert the video in frames. then follow the previous approaches. Or we can also apply object detection/tracking algorithm.
